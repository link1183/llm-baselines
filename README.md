## Installation and running

Our submission's entrypoint is the file `entrypoint.sh`. It will install the dependencies and run the model with our parameters.
Make sure it is executable, by running the following command.

```shell
chmod +x entrypoint.sh
```

You can then run the script, using

```shell
entrypoint.sh
```
